    "about": " I am Hudson Chen, currently pursuing a Master of Engineering in Financial Engineering at Cornell University, where I proudly say, \"Go Big Red!\" My academic journey at Cornell and previously at Queen’s University has honed my skills in mathematics and economics, leading to a deep appreciation for strategy in all aspects of life—from the strategic games I love to play to the strategic decisions I make as a systematic trader. \n \n Currently, I am an intern at Core Value Capital, where I develop trading strategies that not only challenge my analytical skills but also allow me to thrive in a competitive market environment. My role involves designing high-frequency trading strategies and implementing trading algorithms that have successfully navigated various market trends, achieving significant returns. \n My passion for learning and continuous improvement is evident from my projects and internships in both the US and China. Whether it's enhancing trading algorithms or developing predictive models for financial markets, I constantly seek to apply my knowledge in practical, impactful ways. \n \n Looking ahead, I am eager to expand my experience in the finance industry and gain insights from other sectors to broaden my perspective and enhance my versatility. I believe that learning is the point of life, and I am excited to see where this journey of continuous learning and strategic thinking will take me next.",
